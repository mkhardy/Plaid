Hello George,

This is Maurice Hardy from Plaid Customer Support team.
I am here to help you resolve your issue.

The error message you are receiving :

{
 "display_message": null,

 "error_code": "MISSING_FIELDS",

 "error_message": "the following required fields are missing: public_key",

 "error_type": "INVALID_REQUEST",

 "request_id": "Ehvcc"

}



This states that your missing a required field called **public_key** in your curl statement.

Please add the **public_key** to your code and let me know if this works for you.



Please take a look at our [Documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/api/) for API References to validate the syntax properly.

If this was the example you received from the documentation I apologize for the syntax error.

We will verify this and resolve the issue.

Let us know if this works for you or not.

Thanks,
Maurice
